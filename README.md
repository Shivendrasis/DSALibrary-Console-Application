## About the Project
The DSA Library is a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. It is designed to help learners and developers alike to:
- Understand how common data structures and algorithms work.
- Learn best practices for implementing them in Java.
- Apply them in coding interviews, competitive programming, and real-world projects.

## Features
- **Data Structures**: 
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  
- **Algorithms**: 
  - Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
  - Searching (Binary Search, BFS, DFS)
  - Dynamic Programming
  
- **Utilities**:
  - Custom data structure classes for real-world use cases.
  - Utility functions to test performance and correctness of algorithms.

## Installation
To use the DSA Library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
